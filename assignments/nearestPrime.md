# Nearest Prime

You are given an array A of n integer elements a<sub>1</sub>-a<sub>n</sub>. For every element a<sub>i</sub> you have to replace it with its nearest prime no p<sub>i</sub>.If there are two prime no.s at equal distance, replace it with smaller prime. Return the final array after all elements are replaced.

**Sample Input1:**
[7,8,9]

**Sample Output1:**
[7,7,7]

**Sample Input2:**
[10,14,20]

**Sample Output2:**
[11,13,19]

**Constraints:**<br>
1<=n<=100 <br>
1<=i<=n<br>
1<=a<sub>i</sub><=100
